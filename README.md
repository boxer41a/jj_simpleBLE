# jj_simpleBLE
This is an Xcode project to test the [SimpleBLE library](https://github.com/SimpleBLE/SimpleBLE) and to solicit help from StackOverflow or elsewhere for setting up the project.
 
The project contains an XCode project that attempts to use the [SimpleBLE Release v0.9.1](https://github.com/simpleble/simpleble/releases/tag/v0.9.1) static library for MacOS-x64.  (I'm using and Late 2013 iMac, running macOS Catalina Version 10.15.7 and Xcode Version 11.7).

I created a project and cut-and-pasted the code under "Scanning for peripherals" at the [SimpleBLE ReadTheDocs](https://simpleble.readthedocs.io/en/latest/simpleble/tutorial.html) page.  I tried to add the static library and header files.

5/7/25 - I get 'simpleble/SimpleBLE.h' file not found.
